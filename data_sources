The best place to starting a Chinese restaurant in New Jersey
definitely needs a complicated statistical model, while in the current
simplified model only are considered. The following information are
gathered with different techniques: the population of Chinese in each
township of New Jersey, the total number of Chinese restaurants in
each township.

- Department of Labor and Workforce Development of New Jersey made
public the census of New Jersey Labor force through NJ Labor Market
Views. The 2010 census is available online
lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/lpa/pub/lmv/lmv_18.pdf, which links to Asian
alone census
http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/lpa/census/2010/sf1/mcd/asianbymcd.
xls. This is served as the source of distribution of Asian population
including Chinese in municipalities of New Jersey.

- Total number of Chinese restaurants in each municipality. To get an
  estimate of total number of Chinese restaurants in each municipality
  of New Jersey, the foursquare public API is adopted. The key words
  "Chinese Restaurants" is searched via foursquare near each
  municipality, and simply the returned number of venues is taken as
  the total number of Chinese restaurants. In principle, many other
  information such as the rating of the restaurants, the price scale
  of the restaurants could be extracted with the foursquare (or Yelp)
  API, which would add more variables to the current projects. Note
  this is a rough estimate and could be improved by performing more
  accurate searches.


- Also the way to geometrically categorizing Jersey counties into
  North, Central, South Jersey is taken from Wikipedia.
